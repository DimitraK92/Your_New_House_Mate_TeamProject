# YourNewHouseMate

Final group project for the PeopleCert C Sharp Coding Bootcamp (CB13, February 2021). 

This application simulates a platform where people can find roommates for their house. The matching is done via an algorithm which compares answers to questions in a test which all the users need to complete. Results are presented with a match percentage and let the user choose with that in mind. A supposed premium version allows the user to see the other person's answers to the test. 

There is also an an administrative section in the application, where the administrator can make CRUD actions to the database entities. 

This project started with a 4 person team, but due to various reasons, we had to restart it in late August with only 2 people remaining. In three weeks time, as the due date was in September 14, we made the whole application almost from scratch in order to provide both the functionalities we wanted and the needed requirements. 

Enjoy!
